\subsection{Abstract}

\subsection{Introduction}
This project started with a simple Idea -- A calculator that rather than 
working systematically, predicts your answer using a neural network. The 
question which neural network architecture would fit this job best is what 
what truly propelled this project.

This document presents the findings, which have been learned with the 
project: A Predictive Calculator.

\subsection{Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNNs)}
Since the functionality of a FNN has already been discussed in the 
literature study, were mentioned in the methodology document and no new 
information on FNNs has been found since then by the author, this topic 
will not be discussed in this document. 

Though, FNNs will make an appearance later on in this document.
